# Instagram Resizer
## Resizes all jpgs in a directory for Instagram posting

Instagram enforces specific ratios for portrait (4:5) and landscape (1.91:1) photos and a maximum width of 1080px.
This script crawls through the jpgs of a directory and
1. Splits photos that exceed a 8x5 ratio into multiple photos to be posted as a gapless series of portraits
    1.1. Portraits with a ratio <5x8 will be rotated and split
2. Resizes photos to a width of 1080px
